1.Game rules

*Spider Solitaire is a card game:
  1.At the beginning, n columns of cards (n is determined by the user) are randomly dealt.
    Only the bottom card in each column is face-up.
  2.To the right of these n columns is the stock pile, which can be used to deal one card 
    to each column when you want a new set of cards. 
  3.The newly dealt cards are all face-up.When all the face-up cards in a column are 
    removed, the bottom card of that column automatically flips face-up. 
  4.Your objective is to form a sequence of cards of the same suit, from King to Ace (in 
    descending order from top to bottom), which will then be removed from the table. 
  5.Your ultimate goal is to remove all the cards from the table.

*To move cards, you are supposed to input the starting column, starting row, and 
 destination column to drag the cards onto another pile. 

*The rules for moving cards are as follows:
  1.You can move the bottom card of any pile to an empty pile.
  2.You can move the bottom card of a pile onto another card whose face value is one 
    higher than the card you drag.(regardless of suit).
  3.A group of cards of the same suit and in sequential order can be moved as a unit 
    (the starting column and starting row should imply the position of the top card 
    of the group you want to move).
  4.When a complete sequence from King to Ace, with the same suit, is formed, that 
    sequence is removed from the table.
  5.If there are no more moves available or no more meaningful moves to be made, you 
    can press 'r' to deal a new set of cards. Additionally, before dealing a new set 
    of cards, there should be no empty piles.

****************************************
*After choosing 'start a new game' and pressing 'Enter', you will come to the difficulty 
 settings interface.
*You can set the number of columns(i.e. the number of the card piles),
             the number of decks(i.e. how many decks of cards you want to play with)
             the number of suits
             the number of card dealt(i.e. the number of opportunities to deal cards)
*Please move the cursor on your ideal option using 'w''s''a''d'. 
*Only when you finalize all the options should you press 'Enter'.
*Otherwise you may directly start playing the game with incomplete settings because once 
 you press 'Enter', you will go to next interface.
****************************************
*Game starts.
*Please input your command.
*Your command is expected to be one of these three:
  1.'q':quit;
  2.'r':deal;
  3.'a b c':move the card in column a, row b and cards below it(if any) to column c
    or 'a c': move the bottom card of column a to column c
*If your input is not valid, our program will print the error type of your input and 
 waiting for your retry.  

*If you input 'q', you will see 'Back up or not?[y/n]'.
 Input 'y' if you want to back up your game status and continue next time. 
 Otherwise, please input 'n'.
****************************************
*The number after 'Step' on the screen represents the number of successful card movements 
 you have made so far.

*Once you have run out of dealing opportunities, our program will automatically check for 
 a stalemate after each successful move. 
 If a stalemate is detected, you will see two types of hints on your screen:
  1."you are in a stalmate now.": No valid move can be made;
  2."you will probably have no meaningful move after several steps.": 
    Even if there are valid moves, the cards will return to their original positions 
    after several steps.
    such moves are meaningless and will not change the outcome.
*When a complete sequence from King to Ace, with the same suit, is formed, that sequence 
 is removed from the table.
*If you remove all the cards from the table, congratulations, you have completed the game.
 You will return to the first interface.
